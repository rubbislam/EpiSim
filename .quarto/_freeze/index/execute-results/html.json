To introduce partially observed Markov process (POMP) models as tools for scientific investigation and public health policy.\n\n2.  To give students the ability to formulate POMP models of their own.\n\n3.  To teach efficient approaches for performing scientific inference using POMP models.\n\n4.  To familiarize students with the **pomp** package.\n\n5.  To give students opportunities to work with such inference methods.\n\n6.  To provide documented examples for student re-use.\n\n## Lessons\n\n0.  [Instructions for preparing your laptop for the course exercises.](instruction.html)\n\n1.

King](https://kinglab.eeb.lsa.umich.edu/king) and [Edward L. Ionides](https://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~ionides/) at University of Michigan for creating this wonderful course and for helping us developing our own version.\nWe would also like to thank [Zian (Larry) Zhuang](https://www.zianzhuang.com/) from UCLA for serving as a Teaching Assistant in 2024.\n",
