# Simulation-based Inference for Epidemiological Dynamics
### Summary

These are notes, scripts, and quarto files from a short course given by 
[Spencer J. Fox](https://spncrfx.wordpress.com/) and [Qianying Lin](qianylin.com) 
at [Summer Institute in Statistics and Modeling in Infectious Diseases (SISMID)](https://sph.emory.edu/SISMID/index.html), 
starting from 2024.
All codes and notes are adapted from a [previous version](https://kingaa.github.io/sbied/) developed by 
[Aaron King](https://kinglab.eeb.lsa.umich.edu/king/) and [Ed Ionides](https://ionides.github.io/).
From the [course page](https://rubbislam.quarto.pub/episim/) published based on the current repo,
panels lead to topics corresponding to sessions in the course.
Within each panel, **R** scripts are included to reproduce results discussed in course.
These scripts help students understand, digest, explore, and modify the models, results, and analyses out of their interest and curiosity.
